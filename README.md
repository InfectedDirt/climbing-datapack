# Climbing
Ever been stopped by a cliffside? A mountain? Or maybe just a wall that someone built?
Worry no more! With this datapack, you can climb any full block surface! Just walk up to the wall, look at it, and jump! After that, just press WASD to climb up, right, down, and left!
Watch out for your stamina though, as you fall off of the wall when you're too tired to climb!

This datapack is also compatible with my other rpg datapacks.

## Config
The datapack has two configuration files: ```data/rpg/function/config.mcfunction```, for the settings of the core datapack, and ```data/climbing/function/config.mcfunction``` for settings specific to this datapack. 
In those files, just change the values of the scores. Do not change anything but the values, as that might break the pack.
Unless this datapack is the first in the loading priority, the settings in ```data/rpg/function/config.mcfunction``` will have no effect.
